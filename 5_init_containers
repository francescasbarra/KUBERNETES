# INIT CONTAINERS
Init container are containers that run once during startup process of a pod.
A pod can have any number of init containers and they run once once (in order) to completion.


these containers are not the ones of your main application

# Init containers run to completion before the next init contaiener or app containers start
# App containers will start up only once all init containers have completed

Used to perform a variety of startup tasks.
#They can contain and use software and setup scripts that are not needed by your main container.

Useful in keeping the main containers lighter and more secure by offloading startup tasks to a separate container.

USE CASES

# to cause a pod to wait for naother k8s resource to be created before finishing startup
  ex. you can use an init container to pause startup until a service or another pod become available

# to perform sensitive startup steps securely outside of app containers
  ex. se sono necessarie delle azioni che coinvolgono dati sensibili si eseguono in uninit container in mode che, se il container principale risulta compromesso, non verranno compromessi i dati sensibili

# to populate data into a shared volume at startup 
  if you need to output some data to a volume your main container could read that data from that volume once it starts up 

# to communicate with another external service
