RESOURCE REQUESTS AND RESOURCE LIMITS


RESOURCE REQUESTS allow you to define an amount of resources (such as CPU or memory) you expect a container to use.
                  ammontare di cpu ram che si vuole venga allocata con certezza ai pod/che si richieda sia disponibile
The KUBERNETES SCHEDULER  will use RESOURCE REQUESTS to avoid scheduling pods on nodes that don't have enough available resources.

-tip- containers are allowed to use more or less resources than the requesrs resources.
      RESOURCE REQUESTS only affects scheduling

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: busybox
      image: busybox
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: "250m"
          memory: "128Mi"

RESOURCE LIMITS to limit the amount of resource your containers can use

The CONTAINER RUNTIME is responsible for enforcing these limits and different container runetimes do this differently

-tip- some runtimes will enforce these limits by stopping container processes that attempt to use more than the allowed amount of resources

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  -name: busybox
   image: busybix
   resources:
     limits:
       cpu: "250m"
       memory: "128i"
