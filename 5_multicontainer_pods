CREATING MULTI-CONTAINER PODS

#MULTI-CONTAINER PODS: pod with more than one container

in a multi-container pod, the containers share resources such a network and storage.
They can interact each other working together to provide functionality

best practice: to keep containers in separate pods unless they need to share resources

--------

#CROSS-CONTAINER INTERACTION
when containers share the same pod and interact one another using shared resources

NETWORK: containers share the same networking namespace and can communicate each other on any port, even if the port is not exposed to the cluster

STORAGE: containers can use volumes to share data in a pod

Important
SERVICE NodePort = to expose containers on the network, externally exposure
        Cluster Ip = only internal exposure among containers



example multi-container pod manifest

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: multi-container-pod
spec:
 containers:
 - name: busybox
   image: busybox
 - name: redis
   image: redis
 - name: couchbase
   image: couchbase
