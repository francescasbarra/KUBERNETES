BUILDING SELF-HEALING PODS WITH RESTART POLICIES

RESTAR POLICIES VALUES:

#ALWAYS
#ON FAILURE
#NEVER


Restart policies determinano cosa accadr√† quando un container si arresta

k8s can automatically restarts containers when they fail, "restart policies" allows you to customize this behavior by defining when you want a pod's container to be automatically restarted
#restart policies are an important component of self-healing applications, which are automatically repaired when a problem arises

#ALWAYS 
the default restart policy. With this policy containers will always be restarted if they stopo, even if they completed sucesfully.
Used for applications that should be always running

#ON FAILURE
this policy will restart containers ONLY if the container process exits with an error code or if a liveness probe determine it as unhealthy.
Used for applications that need to run successfully and then stop, no need to run it again 

#NEVER
in this case pod's container will never be restarted even if they fail
used for app that should run once and never be automatically restarted
