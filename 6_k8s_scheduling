EXPLORING KUBERNETES SCHEDULING

#SCHEDULING  process of  assigning pods to nodes so that "kubelet" can run them

#SCHEDULER control plane component that handles scheduling

SCHEDULING PROCESS
The K8s Scheduler selects a suitable node for each pod.
It takes in account things like:

-resource requests  vs.available node resources
-various configurations that affect scheduling using node labels


#nodeSelector
you can configure a "nodeSelector" for your pods to limit which Nodes the Pod can be scheduled on.

Node selectors use "node labels" to filter suitable nodes

example
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nginx
spec:
  containers:
  - name: nginx
    image: nginx
# nodeSelector:
#   mylabel: myvalue


#nodeName
you can bypass scheduling and assign a pod to a specific node by name using "nodeName"

#nodeName: worker1


-----------------------

IMPORTANT we have to use default labels of the nodes or we can also assign a new label

# kubect label nodes  #to assign a new label to the node

kubectl label nodes node.name special=true  (special=true is the label
