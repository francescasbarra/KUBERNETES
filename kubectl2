IMPERATIVE COMMANDS and DECLARATIVE METHOD

DECLARATIVE method (the most used)
Define objects using data structures such as YAML or JSON
Creating yaml files and then creating the objects using kubectl create/apply
 

IMPERATIVE commands
Define objects using kubectl commands and flags.
it is faster
example kubectl create deployment my-deploy --image=nginx

--------

Important quick sample yaml with  --dry-run
to run an imperative command without creating the object.

if you combine it with -o yaml you can quickly obtain a simple yaml file you can manipulate (you will have the output of the command in a yaml file)

example
kubectl create deployment my-deploy --image=nginx --dry-run -o yaml

--------

RECORD A COMMAND	
use the --record flag to record the command that was used to make a change, for a later review



example
kubectl scale deployment my-deploy replicas=5 --record
