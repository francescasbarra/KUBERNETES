PODS AND CONTAINER 



APPLICATION CONFIGURATION
when you are running application in K8s, you may want to pass dynamic values to your applications at runtime to control how the behave.
This is know as Application Configuration.


2 primary ways to store configuration data in K8s:


ConfigMaps : objects used for non sensitive information


Secret : objects used for sensitive configuration information (password, username, etc)


--------------------

Important 
CONFIGMAPS store data in the form of a key-value map and you can pass these data to your container application

yaml data

example 

apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap  IMPORTANT
metadata:
  name: my-configmap
data:
  key1: value1
  key2: value2
  key3:
    subkey:
      morekeys: data
      evenmore: some more data
  key4: |
    You can also do
    multi-line
    data.

--------------------

Important
SECRET are similar to COnfigMaps but are designed to store sensitive data, such as passwords or API keys, more securely.
       They are created and used similarly to ConfigMaps

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret  IMPORTANT
metadata:
  name: my-secret
type: Opaque
data:
  username: user
  password: mypass


Important when we create a secret we have to base64 encode


-------------------

IMPORTANT HOW TO PASS THESE DATA TO THE CONTAINER?

2 ways:

1 you can pass them as ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES, these variables will be visible to your container process at runtime

2 they can passed to containers in the form of mounted volumes. The configuration data will appear in files available to the container file system
